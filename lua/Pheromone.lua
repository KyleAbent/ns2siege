// A way for the alien commander to communicate with his minions.
// 
// Goals
//   Create easy way for alien commander to communicate with his team without needing to click aliens and give orders. That wouldnt fit.
//   Keep it feeling bottom-up so players can make their own choices
//   Have orders feel environmental
//
// First implementation
//   Create pheromones that act as a hive sight blip. Aliens can see pheromones like blips on their HUD. Examples: Need healing, Need protection, Building here, 
//   Need infestation, Threat detected, Reinforce. These are not orders, but informational. Its up to aliens to decide what to do, if anything. 
//
//   Each time you create pheromones, it will create a new signpost at that location if there isnt one nearby. Otherwise, if it is a new type, it will remove the 
//   old one and create the new one. If there is one of the same type nearby, it will intensify the current one to make it more important. In this way, each pheromone 
//   has an analog intensity which indicates the range at which it can be seen, as well as the alpha, font weight, etc. (how much it stands out to players).
//
//   Each time you click, a circle animates showing the new intensity (larger intensity shows a bigger circle). When creating pheromones, VAFX play slight gas sound and 
//   foggy bits pop out of the environment and coalesce, spinning, around the new sign post text.
//
//   When mousing over them, a dismiss button appears so the commander and manually delete them if no longer relevant. They also dissipate over time. 
// 
//   Pheromones are public property and have no owner. Any commander can dismiss, modify or grow any other pheromone cloud.
//
//   Show very faint/basic pheromone indicator to marines also. They have an idea that they are nearby, but dont know what (perhaps just play faint sound when created, no visual).
